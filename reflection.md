In this project I made use of the GIthub COpilot to complete it. I let it create several of my functions that were inside my script. TO use Copilot's suggestionI used in line editor and describe the function. After typing that out it spat out what should go inside the functions body.I used it to help me on the clean_column_names and handle_missing_value functions. Copilot gave me a completed script for the first one but on the the second one there was issues with it.
Copilot's suggestions are very helpful, but they do not replace me. As I had to make several modifications to it to make sure that code worked and matched what my project was looking for. Also sometimes COpilot using the inline one suggests something you dont want or need to do so in some cases it is better to use the descriptive comments so you can detail what you want Copilot to do.
This project help me learn about using AI to help you code. COding with Copilot is very fast at completeing simple code and cleaning data, but during my use I found it does struggle and needs human input to add logic and ensure its correctness.
